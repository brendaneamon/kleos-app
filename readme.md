*Kleos* App â€“ Who's Who in Homer's *Iliad*
==========================================

Overview & Purpose of the Application
-------------------------------------
*Instructors (Non-technical) & Developers*

The purpose of this application is to provide secondary- and university-level Classics, mythology, and literature students with a reference that will allow them to keep track of important characters in Homer's *Iliad*. Instructors will add, edit, and delete mythological figures and locations within the application, and students will merely be able to access information through different views.

The current version of the application includes only a single administrative user with access to add, edit, and delete mythological figures and and locations ("homes") from the database. This user will be able to populate additional mythological figures and locations through simple, intuitive forms.

Future versions of this application may include enhancements such as these:
* Ability for student users to search available mythological figures and locations
* Ability for students to sort the figures and locations displayed by various criteria
* Multiple levels of permissions, including both "student" and "instructor" roles
* The ability for students to sort the figures and locations alphabetically or by other criteria
* Links to other pertinent resources, on the web and in hard copy
* Significant improvements to styling, which will ensure a pleasant user experience
